## Task:
Goodcabs aims for significant growth and improved passenger satisfaction in 2024. To assess its performance and make informed, data-driven decisions, the company needs to analyze key metrics such as:

- Trip Volume
- Passenger Satisfaction 
- Repeat Passenger Rate
- Trip Distribution
- Balance Between New and Repeat Passengers

This analysis is essential for ensuring the company’s goals are achieved while maintaining operational excellence. The insights gained will directly guide strategic decisions made by the Chief of Operations.

### Ad hoc Requests:
Address the specific business request questions in SQL to help chief of operations with answers:

1) Business Request 1: City level fare and trip summary report
2) Business Request 2: Monthly city level trips target performance report
3) Business Request 3: City level repeat passenger trip frequency report
4) Business Request 4: Identify cities with highest and lowest total new passengers
5) Business Request 5: Identify month with highest revenue for each city
6) Business Request 6: Repeat passenger rate analysis

## Action:
To address the problem, I designed a four-page Power BI report focusing on:

- Trip Analysis: Helps understand patterns like peak times, popular routes, and trip frequency.
- Passenger Analysis: Focuses on customer behavior, demographics, and repeat passenger trends.
- Revenue Analysis: Tracks earnings, identifies high-performing cities, and provides monthly or seasonal insights.
- Performance Analysis: Evaluates repeat passenger rates and operational efficiency to enhance retention.

This report provides actionable insights for the Chief of Operations to make informed decisions and achieve growth goals.

### For addressing Business Requests:
Utilize SQL to effectively address the Chief of Operations' specific business inquiries by providing clear and concise data-driven insights.

## Result:

### Focus on Underperforming Cities

- Lucknow and Vadodara: Improve driver performance and ride quality through targeted training and enhanced operational processes to boost low ratings and trip counts.
Mysore and Coimbatore: Promote these cities with strategic marketing campaigns and local partnerships to increase trip volumes and revenue.
Enhance Repeat Passenger Retention

- In Surat and Lucknow (highest repeat rates), introduce loyalty programs and exclusive perks to strengthen passenger retention.
For Mysore and Jaipur (lowest repeat rates), analyze the drop-off reasons and address gaps in service or engagement to encourage repeat rides.

### Leverage High-Performing Cities

- Jaipur and Kochi: Use their high ratings, trip volumes, and revenue as benchmarks to replicate success in underperforming cities.
Promote Jaipur’s higher average fare and peak trip months to attract both tourists and locals.
Revenue Optimization

- Increase weekday revenue by offering incentives or discounts, targeting passengers in cities like Lucknow and Surat, which already perform well on weekdays.
Focus on boosting trips in low-revenue months like June with seasonal promotions or event-based offers.

### Drive Tourism-Based Growth

- Jaipur, Vishakhapatnam, and Kochi: Capitalize on high trip frequencies by partnering with tourism boards and offering ride packages for tourists.
Enhance Driver and Passenger Experience

- Improve driver performance in low-rated cities (Lucknow and Vadodara) with regular training and rewards for excellent service.
Introduce a feedback-driven improvement plan to address passenger pain points effectively.

### Promote New Passenger Acquisition

- Double down on Mysore, Jaipur, and Chandigarh, which lead in new passenger rates, by offering first-ride discounts and targeted campaigns to sustain growth.
- Highlight high-performing months (like February) to maximize promotional efforts during peak demand.

### Innovative Fare Strategies

- Address low average fares in Surat by reevaluating pricing strategies or introducing premium ride options.
- Encourage high-revenue cities to sustain their growth by maintaining competitive yet profitable fare structures.

By implementing these recommendations, GoodCabs can target specific growth opportunities, improve passenger satisfaction, and maximize revenue potential.
