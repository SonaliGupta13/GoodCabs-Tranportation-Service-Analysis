## Task:
Goodcabs aims for significant growth and improved passenger satisfaction in 2024. To assess its performance and make informed, data-driven decisions, the company needs to analyze key metrics such as:

- Trip Volume
- Passenger Satisfaction 
- Repeat Passenger Rate
- Trip Distribution
- Balance Between New and Repeat Passengers

This analysis is essential for ensuring the companyâ€™s goals are achieved while maintaining operational excellence. The insights gained will directly guide strategic decisions made by the Chief of Operations.

### Ad hoc Requests:
Address the specific business request questions in SQL to help chief of operations with answers:

1) Business Request 1: City level fare and trip summary report
2) Business Request 2: Monthly city level trips target performance report
3) Business Request 3: City level repeat passenger trip frequency report
4) Business Request 4: Identify cities with highest and lowest total new passengers
5) Business Request 5: Identify month with highest revenue for each city
6) Business Request 6: Repeat passenger rate analysis

## Action:
To address the problem, I designed a four-page Power BI report focusing on:

- Trip Analysis: Helps understand patterns like peak times, popular routes, and trip frequency.
- Passenger Analysis: Focuses on customer behavior, demographics, and repeat passenger trends.
- Revenue Analysis: Tracks earnings, identifies high-performing cities, and provides monthly or seasonal insights.
- Performance Analysis: Evaluates repeat passenger rates and operational efficiency to enhance retention.

This report provides actionable insights for the Chief of Operations to make informed decisions and achieve growth goals.

### For addressing Business Requests:
Utilize SQL to effectively address the Chief of Operations' specific business inquiries by providing clear and concise data-driven insights.
